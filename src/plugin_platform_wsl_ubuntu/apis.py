"""What WSL Ubuntu attaches to (plugin API 2.2, liminal_libs.sources.apis; the user, 2026-11-11: "each plugin should
reflect the the API its attached to, and present links that provide documentation ... it should also expose more of
what the API is about"): wsl.exe, Ubuntu's APT inside Liminal-Ubuntu, Docker Engine from Docker's own repository, and
the install's init (systemd). Every address was read on the makers' own pages on 2026-11-11 (`VERIFIED`).

The code that drives them is the library's (liminal_libs.machines.wsl, WslDistribution); the cards are this plugin's:
`facts` says what the plugin kept of them while it ran (asking nothing)."""
